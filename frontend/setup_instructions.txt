Setup completed successfully! Here's how to run the project:

1. **Backend (Python)**:
   - Navigate to the 'backend' folder and activate the virtual environment:
     cd cdp_chatbot/backend
     source venv/Scripts/activate
   - Run the backend server:
     python app.py
   - The backend will run at http://localhost:5000.

2. **Frontend (React)**:
   - Navigate to the 'frontend' folder and install dependencies:
     cd cdp_chatbot/frontend
     npm install
   - Run the frontend React app:
     npm start
   - The frontend will run at http://localhost:3000.

Once both servers are running, you can interact with the chatbot by typing questions into the frontend and receiving answers from the backend.

Good luck!
